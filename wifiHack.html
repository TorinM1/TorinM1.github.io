									<h3 class="major">Cracking the four way handshake (dictionary attack)</h3>
									<p>In order to crack the four way WPA2 handshake we first need to intercept a device connecting to the router. In order to do this, we need a network adapater that supports monitor mode so we can see the traffic on the router. After some reseach I decided to get the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004Y6MIXS?linkCode=gs2&tag=howtofixandre-21">Alfa Network AWUS036NHA</a>, as this was well recomended for it's compatibility with Kali. I will be displaying the step by step process I took to crack a pre-set password from the four way handshake using commands from Kali Linux. <br /> <br /> Steps: <br /> 1) Firstly, we need to make sure that there will be nothing interfering with the Wi-Fi adapter's monitor mode. To do this we run the command  <code>sudo airmon-ng check kill</code> This will make sure that there is no conflicting processes with airmon-ng. <br /> <br /> 2) Then we need to start the network adapter. After running <code>ifconfig</code> we can see the new network adapter that we have to place into monitor mode, in my case this is wlan0. This is achieved by running <code>sudo airmon-ng start wlan0</code> <br /> <br /> 
									3) Then, to ennumerate all of the Wi-Fi routers around, we can run <code>sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon</code> replacing wlan0mon with your network adapter if it is not the same. This will give us all of the MAC Addresses of the routers and what channel they run on. <br /><br /> 4) From here, we can run <code> sudo airodump-ng -w outputName -c channelNum --bssid routerMAC wlan0mon </code> replacing the channelNum and bssid with the information from the previous command. This will allow us to capture the handshake from a device. <br /><br /> 5) To capture this we need a device to connect to the router so we can intercept the singal. The easiest way to do this is to run the command <code>sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a routerMAC wlan0mon</code>. This will send disauthentication frames to all of the devices on the network, forcing them to disconnect. This will allow us to capture the handshake when they automatically rejoin the network. <br /><br /> 6) Once the handshake has been intercepted from the command in step 4, this will output the handshake in different file formats. The one that we are interested in is the .cap file. From here we can run <code> aircrack-ng output.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code> or any other wordlist that you want to use. If the password is weak, it will likely be in the rockyou txt file, and if so, you would have successfully cracked the password! If it is more complicated, then a brute-force attack will be needed which I will cover in the next section. </p>
